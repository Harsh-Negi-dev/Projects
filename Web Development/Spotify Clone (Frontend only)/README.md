<b>Intro</b>
<br>
This is a simple frontend clone of Spotify built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a basic user interface that mimics Spotify's layout and includes limited interactive functionality like:
Play/Pause buttons
Two clickable music cards (with audio playback)
Basic responsive layout and styling with CSS
<br>
<br>
<b>Project Goal</b>
<br>
This project was created to practice frontend development and UI design by replicating the look and feel of a popular music streaming platform. The focus was on layout, styling, and adding minimal interactivity using vanilla JavaScript.

<b>Technologies Used</b>
<br>
HTML – for structuring the layout
CSS – for styling the UI and responsiveness
JavaScript – for play/pause logic and audio playback
