<b>Intro</b>
This is a simple web-based chess game built using only HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It includes basic gameplay features such as:
A standard 8x8 black-and-white chessboard
Correct movement rules for all chess pieces
Turn-based logic (White and Black alternate turns)
Basic capturing of opponent pieces
Prevention of illegal moves (e.g. blocked paths)

<b>Project Details</b>
This project was created to practice DOM manipulation and implement core chess logic from scratchâ€”without any external libraries or game engines.

<b>Technologies Used</b>
HTML for structure
CSS for styling the board and pieces
JavaScript for game logic and move handling
